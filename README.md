# Outlet-Establishment (Blinkit)

## Project Objective

To analyze and visualize Blinkit’s sales performance across outlets by location, size, item types, fat content, and establishment year in order to identify sales trends, customer preferences, and opportunities for growth.

* Specifically, the dashboard aims to:
* Track total sales, average sales, number of items, and customer ratings.
* Compare fat content sales (Low Fat vs Regular).
* Analyze item types contributing most to sales.
* Measure sales distribution by outlet size and location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
* Monitor trends over years (Outlet Establishment performance).
* Evaluate outlet type performance (Supermarket Type1, Type2, Type3, Grocery Store).

## Process

1. **Data Collection**

   * Gather sales data from Blinkit’s outlets (covering items, sales amount, ratings, outlet size, location, fat content, and establishment year).

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handle missing or inconsistent values.
   * Standardize categorical fields (Outlet Type, Item Types, Fat Content).

   * Compare **Low Fat vs Regular** product sales.
   * Track sales growth over years using **Outlet Establishment trends**.

4. **Data Visualization (Dashboard Creation)**

   * Use charts/graphs:

     * **Pie charts** for fat content & outlet size.
     * **Bar charts** for item types & outlet location.
     * **Line chart** for year-wise sales trend.
   * Add KPI cards for quick insights (Total Sales, No. of Items, Avg Sales, Avg Rating).
   * Include a **filter panel** (Outlet Location, Outlet Size, Item Type).

5. **Insights & Reporting**

   * Identify **top-performing item categories** (e.g., Fruits & Snack Foods).
